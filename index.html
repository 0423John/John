So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trust in who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
</p>
<p>
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new 
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know
</p>
<p>
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah

Open mind for a different view

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, ooh, yeah
